# Design Inspiration:
1. [Brittany Chiang's portfolio for inspiration](https://brittanychiang.com/#about)

The site's design is heavily inspired by Brittany Chiang's portfolio, to the point where I literally copied the design. However note that I still coded this all on my own, so I hope you'll grant me some credit on that part. But yeah I'd like to give a special thanks to her since she is truly impressive.
